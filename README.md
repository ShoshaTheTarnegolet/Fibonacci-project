# Fibonacci project

My second project for Front-End Development Program. You can save calculations in the firebase database and sort it by date or input number.

Design isn't mine, it was on assignment at Figma, it's a simple bootstrap design.

Here you can find:

1. my Fibonacci function with recursion;
2. sorting function;
3. work with realtime database;
4. loader, Date, memo function;

You can try [it](https://fibonacci-project.web.app/)
