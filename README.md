# Fibonacci project

My second project for frontend course. It's Fibonacci calculator that also work with the server. Design isn't mine, it was on assignment at Figma, it's a simple bootstrap design.
I've made a Fibonacci function with recursion also learnt handling errors and axios and how to make a sorting.
