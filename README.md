# Fibonacci project

My second project for frontend course. It's Fibonacci calculator that also work with the express server. Design isn't mine, it was on assignment at Figma, it's a simple bootstrap design.
Here you can find:

1. my Fibonacci function with recursion;
2. sorting function;
3. handling errors and promises whith axios;
4. loader, Date, memo function;

# to run Fibonacci server:

Clone the repo (all commands are in the terminal in linux/mac or cmd in windows)

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/israeltechchallenge/fibonacci-server
```

Then enter to the created folder

```bash
> cd fibonacci-server
```

Install the required dependencies with npm (make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, npm comes with that)

```bash
> npm install
```

## Running The Server Locally

Then you can run the server

```bash
> node app.js
```

You should see something like this:

```bash
App listening on port 5050
Press Ctrl+C to quit.
```
